I’ve been entering a new domain (spacecraft design) and am again finding myself as the apprentice. It is, as you already know, painful. Looking like a senior and acting like a junior causes a discordance internally that is never comfortable.
The opportunity to learn things outweighs the pain of feeling close to forty but being as confused as a twenty year old at the same time. This experience has raised a question: what are my seniors getting out of this?

# The Hassle
I can be a hassle for senior engineers. In moments when I’m learning what Atomic Oxygen is, I prove this to them and myself.  I left a domain I was approaching expertise in (terrestrial automation and machine design) for which I have a professional license and years of experience. At the start of my new role I could barely walk, metaphorically. So why would they hire me?
I can speak for my own experience in bringing up junior engineers, and assume the same is true for them.

# 1. New perspective diversity.
Looking at problems through a new (for them) lens has value and prevents ossification. Consequently - you can quickly identify technical organizations that don’t take this advantage of new hires seriously. You have to hire novices, train them, but embark on the incredibly painful process of taking their bad ideas seriously: eventually, they will have some unique ones that will be valuable to the seniors. If technical organizations don’t, you can smell the pessimism and stultification the second you enter the room. This usually presents itself as “It’s the way we’ve always done it before, Junior”-ism.

# 2. It teaches seniors.
Acting like a filtering mechanism, mentoring juniors can highlight areas of expertise a senior thought they had, but realized upon inspection through teaching a junior that their expertise was really a basic understanding. This is a continual improvement process for both the senior and the junior. It reinforces knowledge Seniors already had, and shows them where they themselves need to grow.

# 3. It’s the right thing to do.
Organizations that do the difficult things are the ones that are proving that they are willing to do difficult things. They are more likely to make difficult decisions and put in the work to change course as required. It’s the right thing to do because we were all juniors at one point.

# 4. Disproportionate return on risk of talent.
I heard recently that the job of a startup founder is to hire people who haven’t established themselves in their career yet, because those are the only ones they should be able to afford (if you’re optimizing capital). I like this idea: a proven expert costs a proven expert’s salary. This can be an unlock as if your hiring process is great as you’re consistently disproportionately  reaping the reward of this high risk approach.

# 5-ish. You filter for good fits.
More senior staff can have habits and personas adopted from previous organizations. “Blank slate hires” are less likely to have bad (and probably good) habits picked up from previous organizations. Bad habits are harder to break than good habits are to teach. Ultimately, good fits will be more inclined to stay. Caution to organizations hiring out of college engineers - make sure their compensation is commensurate with their rate of knowledge gain. A new engineer will learn and become more useful over time than a senior engineer, initially, and so their salary should increase at a rate that would seem unfair to a senior.


Ultimately, I don’t know if five is actually true yet, so I’m going to waver on it a bit. Please let me know if you have any others you’d like to see on this list.
