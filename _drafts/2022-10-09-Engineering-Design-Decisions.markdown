# Every Decision Needs a Reason
# When You Don't Have a Reason, Find it
Cost
Manufacturability
Time
# What is correct?

# Engineering is the art of Approximation
Structural engineering examples
# Prototyping is King
You learn more in one failed prototype than the alternative
# Make a Decision, Move on
