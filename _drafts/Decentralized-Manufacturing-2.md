        The problem with ignoring the art of manufacturing, this is one small part
        How this fell through
        Makerspaces have trouble existing
        Safety issues
What about decentralized manufacturing?
 
# Advantages of Decentralization
walmart example
experts are readily available to each of your 
resillience
        we had an entire shop shut down for a day because of a fire

# Disadvantages of Decentralization
complexity
cost
edge costs
draw similarities to the cloud
unique processes
