title:  "The Future of Decentralized Manufacturing: Part 1 of 3"
---
There's a trend in manufacturing that is in opposition to what I thought to be true ten years ago.
Additive manufacturing (3D printing, mainly) meant making things should become cheaper and easier.

I want to explain what I thought would happen (decentralized manufacturing), what did happen (faster manufacturing for limited cases) and what I think will actually happen in the future (dispersed manufacturing).

# The Promise of Decentralization
Additive manufacturing meant easily (relatively speaking) making parts digitally with little to no waste. The cost of digital fabrication equipment (CNC Routers, desktop CNC machines, etc) would continue to decrease in cost and become more and more accessible to anyone with a power outlet and some indoor space to operate the machinery in.

In a world where the cost of purchasing and operating manufacturing equipment approached zero, the accessibility would be inversely related. Garages everywhere would have alongside their standard toolbox and project car, a Shopbot CNC Router now at a cost that a standard middle class home owner could afford. This could shift manufacturing from centralized facilities towards a decentralized model, pushing manufacturing to the edges

In the early aughts, CAD was becoming ubiquitous. AutoCAD was now more common than a drafting table.




# What Actually Happened
So what did happen? Prototyping became cheaper, for one.

We can now 3D print non-structural parts in hours. The idea that a manufacturing laymen (often times, an engineer) can turn an undimensioned CAD model into an actual part should still shock anyone. This has changed the way engineers think about cost, forever. As an example: when designing a mechatronic system, limit switches and sensors are critical where axes of motion interact with each other, or with themselves (say, a hard-stop for example). Fine tuning the kinematics of the system and the placement of sensors could take hours or days. Today, I can pay some amount of attention to it, and know that when I get it wrong, I can easily crank out a new bracket on a 3D printer by the end of the day. This makes prototyping faster.

In the case for sensor mounting on prototypes, additive manufacturing works well. However, there are still limitations to additive manufacturing. Structural parts for example are usually an immediate culling of your manufacturing options, usually removing any additive manufacturing options. Markforged has made decent strides in affordable structural parts, but not in a meaningful way. For example, their carbon fiber reinforced FDM printing does provide stronger parts, but not in a quantifiable way as they cannot provide yield or ultimate tensile stresses with which to analyze against. Fundamentally, if I cannot analyze a part for structural strength, it cannot be a structural part. See their design guide for reference: https://static.markforged.com/downloads/CompositesDesignGuide.pdf

Even if Markforged could provide those values, only a small percentage of engineers understand analyzing anisotropic materials, or would find it worth the time as opposed to cutting a part from metal and moving on with their day.



# The Reality


The thought experiment of "What is affordably available today that was not affordably available ten or twenty years ago" gives you a sense of the things you're taking for granted, what others are not taking advantage of.
